// AcceptedDivergence records a case where authz-agent knowingly answers
// differently from the legacy golden.
//
// This is NOT a way to silence a failing case. The case still runs, still calls
// the agent, and its response is still compared byte-for-byte — only against the
// recorded divergent answer instead of the golden. Three outcomes follow:
//
//   - the agent matches the golden        -> pass (the divergence is gone; the
//     entry here is now stale and should be deleted)
//   - the agent matches this record       -> pass, with a line in the test log
//   - the agent matches neither           -> fail
//
// So a regression that changes the answer a third way is still caught, which is
// the property a t.Skip would have thrown away.
